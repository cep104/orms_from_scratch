## Heredoc in Ruby
A heredoc is a way to define a multiline string, while maintaining the original indentation & formatting. ([source](https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/11/ruby-heredoc/))

It behaves exactly the same way as a string, with the exception that it tries to preserve formatting. You open it up with this `<<-` and a name, such as SQL (if you're a good developer) or BATMAN. Then you close it with the same name.

```ruby
  string = <<-BATMAN
    All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
  BATMAN
  # string = "    All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\n"
```

It's ideal for writing SQL.

```ruby
  sql = <<-SQL
    SELECT * FROM tweets
  SQL
  DB[:conn].execute(sql)
```

## Returning Hashes
SQLite database instances can be set to return values as hashes with
`.results_as_hash = true`

## Avoiding SQL Injection Attacks

Never string interpolate into your SQL. Instead, use `?` where you'd put a value, and then add the values as arguments to your `execute` call in the order that you'd like them replaced. For instance:

```ruby
  sql = <<-SQL
    UPDATE tweets
    SET content = ?, author = ?
    WHERE id = ?;
  SQL
  DB[:conn].execute(sql, self.content, self.author, self.id)
```

This way, someone tweeting "; DROP TABLE tweets;" won't delete all your tweets.

# Old Tips

## Implementing Bundler

Bundler allows you to denote which gems the app uses and lock your specific version. Then, it gives others a command to automatically install those gems. It's a great gem version tracker for large apps.

Start by using `bundle init` and then you can add gems to the gemfile.

Include the bundler by adding `require 'bundler'` and `Bundler.require` to the top of your code.

## Using Rake

Rake allows you to define ruby tasks to initiate from the command line. To use it, first make sure you have Rake installed with `gem install rake`.

After this, create a file called `Rakefile` (no .rb necessary) in your root directory. After this, rake tasks can be defined like this:

```ruby
task :say_hi do
  puts "hi"
end
```

Once you've done this, you can run that ruby code by typing `rake say_hi` into the console while in the project's directory.

If you would like to have one rake task call another rake task (say, to require your environment file before opening up a pry session), you can use the following syntax:

```ruby
task :say_bye => :say_hi do
  puts "bye"
end
```

Running `rake say_bye` in the console will now puts "hi" and then puts "bye".

## Creating a run file with bin

Using bin is a common method to allow us to run our executable without calling `ruby` in our terminal.

Properly set up, it will allow you to run your code by simply writing `bin/run` in your terminal.

To make your run file a bin file, create a directory called `bin` in your root directory. Inside it, create a file with the name that you want to use to run it. For example, if I create a file named `batman`, I will eventually be able to run it with `bin/batman`. You do not need to add a `.rb`.

A bin file should start with a shebang statement to let your computer know what language to use to run it. It is usually this: `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`

Afterwards, treat it as a regular ruby file. Any ruby code in the bin file with a proper shebang statement should be runable from your main directory as `bin/batman` (or whatever you named the file.)

If your VSCode doesn't recognize it as Ruby and you want to see your normal color highlighting, hit the portion that says something like "Plain Text" at the bottom right corner of the screen.

If, for some reason, you run `bin/[YOUR FILENAME]` and get "Permission denied", you can give it write access with the following code in your terminal:
```chmod +x bin/[YOUR FILENAME]```

Alternatively, you can run it by calling `ruby bin/[YOUR FILENAME]`.

# Commands Reference

## Table Commands

Create a Table:
```SQL
CREATE TABLE cheeses (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, smelly INTEGER, name TEXT);
```

SQLite accepts the following value types: Integer, real, text, blob, null.

Add a Column to a Table:
```SQL
ALTER TABLE cheeses ADD COLUMN age INTEGER;
```

Delete a table:

```SQL
DROP TABLE cheeses;
```

## CRUD Commands

Create
  ```SQL
    -- INSERT INTO [tableName] (attr1, attr2) VALUES (value1, value2);
    INSERT INTO states (name, population) VALUES (“New York”, 19);
  ```
Never add an ID when inserting!

Read
  ```SQL
  --  SELECT [what we want to select] FROM [tableName] WHERE attr [conditional] "attr_value";
  SELECT * FROM states WHERE name = "New York";
 ```
Update
```SQL
  -- UPDATE [tableName] SET [columnName] = [new value] WHERE [columnName] = [value];
  UPDATE states SET population = 20 WHERE name = “New York”;
```
Delete
```SQL
  -- DELETE FROM [tableName] WHERE [columnName] = [value];
  DELETE FROM states WHERE name = “New York”;
```
